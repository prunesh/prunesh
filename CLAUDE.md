# CLAUDE.md

## Architecture

Two independent phases:

1. **Go binary** (`gtkai`): filtering and token reduction logic.
2. **Claude Code plugin**: registers hooks, templates, and the include in the global `CLAUDE.md`.

Never collapse both phases into one. The plugin depends on the binary. The binary does not configure Claude Code.

## Versions

When changing the version, update every file that exposes it:

- `cmd/gtkai/main.go`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `modules/mcpscan/mcpscan.go`
- `README.md`

To check no old references remain:

```bash
grep -rn "X.Y.Z" . --include="*.go" --include="*.json" --include="*.md"
```

The git tag must match the version in code. The release CI workflow enforces this.

## Language

Filtering is heuristic: truncation, extension grouping, comment stripping, line limits. It is not semantic compression or intelligent deduplication.

Use: heuristic pruning, rule-based filtering, deterministic truncation.  
Avoid: intelligent compression, semantic optimization, smart deduplication.

## Before committing

- Tests pass (`go test ./...`).
- If the change affects the hook or filtering, test with a real payload before committing.
- If the install flow changes, validate the full user path, not just compilation.
- If the version is bumped, verify all version-bearing files are updated.
